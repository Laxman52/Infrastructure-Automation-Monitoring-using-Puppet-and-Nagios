Tool Coordination for a Static SiteThe tools work in coordination, demonstrating a robust and repeatable Continuous Deployment pipeline:Phase 1: Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)Terraform's role remains the same—it builds the foundation so your deployment is repeatable.ToolActionOutcomeTerraformProvisions: Defines and launches two EC2 instances (Web Server and Nagios Server).Foundation: Secure, networked infrastructure ready for configuration.TerraformNetworking: Sets up the Security Group for the Web Server to allow inbound HTTP (Port 80/443) from the public internet and necessary monitoring checks from the Nagios Server.Connectivity: The website is accessible, and monitoring can begin.Phase 2: Configuration and Deployment (Ansible)Ansible is the workhorse here. It replaces the simple single-file deployment with a recursive file transfer to deploy your full static site.ToolAction (Playbooks)OutcomeAnsible (Web Server)Setup: Installs the web server package (httpd or Nginx) and ensures the service is running.Web Server Ready: The necessary software is installed.Ansible (Web Server)Deployment: Uses the copy or synchronize module to recursively copy your entire local website folder (containing all HTML, CSS, and JS files) to the Web Server's Document Root (/var/www/html).Full Site Deployed: All website assets are in place.Ansible (Web Server)Permissions: Sets file ownership and permissions (e.g., owner=apache, mode=0644) on all transferred files and folders so the web server can read them.Functional Site: The website can be served to users without permission errors.Ansible (Nagios Server)Configuration: Installs Nagios Core and necessary plugins, and deploys the specific configuration files required to monitor the Web Server.Monitoring Setup: Nagios is ready to start checking the deployed website.Phase 3: Monitoring (Nagios)Nagios provides the operational feedback loop, confirming the success of the deployment.ToolActionOutcomeNagiosWebsite Check: Runs a constant HTTP check on the Web Server's public IP (e.g., Port 80/443).Uptime Assurance: Confirms the deployment was successful and the website is accessible to the public.NagiosHealth Check: Runs a PING check to ensure the server is online and reachable.Infrastructure Assurance: Confirms the underlying network and server OS are stable.
